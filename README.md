# getOCR
I use this to pull and read images, pdf and other files on a website with the Google OCR technology.
The file is pulled from the url you provide, stored as a word document in your Google Drive in a specified folder of your choice.
It is then read and returned as text in google script.
Since I use it mulitple times in a day as part of webscraping, I have added the code for the name of the file to be searched for in the Google Drive before you pull data from the website. This decreases the amount of pulls on websites which could potentially block you from pulling data multiple times during a short period of time.
